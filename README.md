## MUSA508-Final

**Cypress Marrs and Briana Cervantes**

If you have ever felt like NJ Transit needed work, you are not wrong. In January 2019, stations across the New Jersey transit system experienced the equivalent of about 1 year 8 months worth of delays.

But what if you could know your train was running late before it was running late?

**At eNJine, we are making this possible.**
